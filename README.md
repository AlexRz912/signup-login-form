# signup-login-form

This is a very basic signup/login form. Sign up asks for your name, last name, mail address and password. 
Once you signed up, you can login using mail and password. says welcome onsite if you signed up and logged in properly.

You need to open signup-form.php to start. If you already signed up before, you can open login-form.php

I'll later implement a page that asks if you want to signup or login.
